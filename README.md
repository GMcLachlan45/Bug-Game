# Bug-Game 2
COSC 414 Project 2 with the lads

## Objectives (80%): ##

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.The playing field starts at the surface of a sphere centered at the origin.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.The player can drag the sphere to rotate to look for bacteria (under interactive contol)\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Bacteria grow on the surface of the sphere starting at an arbitrary spot on the surface and growing out uniformly in all directions from that spot at a speed determined by the game\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.The player needs to eradicate the bacteria by placing the mouse over the bacteria and hitting a button.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.The effect of the poison administered is to immediately remove the poisoned bacteria.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.The game can randomly generate up to a fixed number (say 10) of different bacteria (each with a different color).\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.The bacteria appear as a ccolored circular patch on the surface of the sphere.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.The game gains points through the delays in the user responding and by any specific bacteria reaching a threshold (for example,a diameter of a 30 degree arc on a great circle of the sphere). \
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.The player wins if all  bacteria are poisoned before any two different bacteria reach the threshold mentioned above.
    
### Bonus (10% per): ###

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.The effect of the poison administered also propagates outward from the point of insertion of the position until all the bacteria are destroyed.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.When two bacteria cultures collide, the first one to appear on the circumference dominates and consumes the later generated bacteria.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.When a bacterial culture is hit, use a simple 2D particle system to simulate an explosion at the point where the poison is administered.\
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.Lighting is used. Use GUI control to enable or disable lighting.\
